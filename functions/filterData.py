This function filters the data with respect to the defined filters.
It can remove and add filters depending on their presence in the filters-
variable.

INPUT:
    filters: String, separated by commas and a space ", "
    bacteria: String, The bacteria which needs to be added or removed
    dataBackup: n*3 numpy matrix, the raw datafile

OUTPUT:
    filters: String, separated by commas and a space ", "
    data: A filtered n*3 numpy matrix of type:
          [int, float, string]
          
          Where the integer is temperature, float is the growth rate and string
          is the bacteria
    
USAGE:
    filters = filterData(filters,bacteria,dataBackup)[0]
    data = filterData(filters,bacteria,dataBackup)[1]
    
    Or
    
    filters,data = filterData(filters,bacteria,dataBackup)
